Day 1

There was 40 people signed up for the program but only 27 of use showed up today.
Only 21 people had actually did the pre-work so did I waste my time on it?
We started on the course work. I was mainly pre-work that I had already done.
However I thought it would be good if I watched it so I would hopefully learn
something new. Sadly I didn't and now I've wasted most of my time. I wish I would
have skipped it like everyone else. That was all I did today I learned about HTML
today. Things like `<div></div>`, `<p></p>`, and `<i></i>` I already knew this
so wasted my time on all this. That would be the last thing I did on the first
day. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
