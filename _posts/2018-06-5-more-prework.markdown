Day 2

I thought I was done with the pre-work but it turns out that I'm not even close
I still have to do CSS. Everyone lost some progress on our percentage. I lost
15% and that made me lose a lot of motivation. I don't think I'm the only one
that lost some motivation but I'm glad I'm still here we already had two people
leave. I think that I will eventually be done with this pre-work I learned about
`font-size`, `color`, and `display`. It still shows no sign of being done.
