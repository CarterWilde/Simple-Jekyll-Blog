Day 3

Here I thought that I would be done with the pre-work and be on the projects by
now but we are learning about a thing called SCSS and SASS I like SASS more than
SCSS so I think I will go with that style. I thought we were going to learn about
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React but we haven't touched React and JavaScript yet!
I'm still scared of learning JavaScript I heard it's really annoying. The thought
of php makes it not as bad.
