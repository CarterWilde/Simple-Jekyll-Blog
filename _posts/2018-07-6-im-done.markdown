I haven't posted in a while... Well that's because I've fallen asleep most days.
I can't take it any more I'm quitting Code To Success! All we do here is watch
Jordan talk 4 hours a day. I could be playing terraria instead of staying up till
5am play terraria and falling asleep for one hour and then waking up to go listen
to Jordan. I always fall asleep and then have to restart.
